## Overview  
This dashboard focuses on comprehensive analytics regarding "Data Analyst" job roles globally. It presents actionable insights for job seekers, educators, and hiring professionals by breaking down salary levels, remote work trends, required qualifications, geographic hotspots, and job posting platforms.  

## Key Features  
- Median yearly and hourly salary breakdowns for Data Analysts.  
- Visualization of degree requirements, work-from-home (WFH) options, and health insurance availability.
- Interactive world map showing job opportunity hotspots.
- Job distribution by major platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.).
- Full-time, contract, part-time, and internship opportunity proportions.
- High-level analytics on total data job postings, top required skills (e.g., Python, SQL), and comparative salary analysis across other data roles.

## Key Concepts Used
- KPI Indicator Cards & Donut Charts (salary, benefits, job features)
- Map Visualizations (job location distribution)
- Horizontal Bar and Stacked Bar Charts (skills, platforms, job types)
- Drill-through Navigation (filtering dashboard by job title)
- Data Model Relationships & Calculated Columns
- Role-based Filtering and Slicers for interactivity
